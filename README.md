Deployed models:
- Linear Regression.
- XGBoost
- Random Forest.
- Decision Tree.

<br/>


Column Descriptions:
1. Unnamed: drop this column (it's a duplicate index column)
2-3. ItinID & MktID: vaguely demonstrates the order in which tickets were ordered (lower ID #'s being ordered first)
4. MktCoupons: the number of coupons in the market for that flight
5. Quarter: 1, 2, 3, or 4, all of which are in 2018
6. Origin: the city out of which the flight begins
7. OriginWac: USA State/Territory World Area Code
8. Dest: the city out of which the flight begins
9. DestWac: USA State/Territory World Area Code
10. Miles: the number of miles traveled
11. ContiguousUSA: binary column -- (2) meaning flight is in the contiguous (48) USA states, and (1) meaning it is not (ie: Hawaii, Alaska, off-shore territories)
12. NumTicketsOrdered: number of tickets that were purchased by the user
13. Airline Company: the two-letter airline company code that the user used from start to finish (key codes below)
14. PricePerTicket: target prediction column


<br/>
Check for correlations:

From the correlation heat map, it is observed that ‚ÄúMiles‚Äù is the most correlated feature to the target feature (price), the rest have very little influence on the target feature.

<br/>
Observe relationship between price per ticket vs miles:

From the above lineplot, a mild linear relationship is observed between price per ticket and miles.
